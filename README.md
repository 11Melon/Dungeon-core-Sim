# Dungeon-core-Sim
Just a free download for perchance.org that has a custom code to help keep track of stuff.

Just download the most recent file named perchance-characters-export and import it into perchance to get three different settings for you to play around with.

Any discrepancies between the character chats will be sorted out as I fix/build the code/characters more.

The only working import is from 2025-01-05. The 2025-01-10 does not work as intended but is closer to my current progress.

Currently on hold so I can finish my work for school.
